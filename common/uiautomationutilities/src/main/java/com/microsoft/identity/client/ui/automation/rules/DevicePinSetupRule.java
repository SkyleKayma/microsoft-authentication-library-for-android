/**
 * A test rule that allows you to either set a PIN on the device or remove an existing PIN from the
 * device based on the nature of the test case i.e. based on the broker being used in the test.
 * <p>
 * If the test is using Authenticator app then we would just remove the PIN from the device because
 * if the device has a PIN then Authenticator turns on App Lock and some dialogs pop up when you
 * launch Authenticator in such case and it is very complex to handle that UI during automation and
 * we are better off not handling that UI in the first place by ensuring that the device doesn't
 * have a lock.
 * <p>
 * If the test is using Company Portal then we would set a PIN on the device because some test cases
 * exercise conditional policies to require a PIN to be set on the device. Instead of setting it
 * within the test case when such a need arises, we would rather just set it here in the rule prior
 * to starting the test because it just keeps test code much simpler and cleaner.
 * <p>
 * If the test is using Broker Host then we really don't care as the test code is not affected by
 * whether there is a PIN on the device or not.
