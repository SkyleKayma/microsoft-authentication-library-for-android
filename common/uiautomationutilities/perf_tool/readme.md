### Definition of terms:
[**PerfMarker / CodeMarker:**](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/dev/common/src/main/java/com/microsoft/identity/common/PerfConstants.java#L36) A marker in code that results in an event to capture timestamp and other details as needed (Memory, Thread ID, CorrelationID etc. and write to file). The data generated from a CodeMarker can be used for Perf, logging, Telemetry etc.

[**Measurement:**](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/dev/uiautomationutilities/perf_tool/PerfDataConfiguration.xml#L4) A pair of markers identified for a transaction. E.g. If can have marker M1 at the beginning of a silent request and another when we successfully received a token say M2. Now M1 and M2 can be paired together if we were interested in measuring time between these. Pairing is an outside concept and has no impact from a code perspective.

[**Scenario:**](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/dev/uiautomationutilities/perf_tool/PerfDataConfiguration.xml#L18-L25) An E2E scenario that we would be interested in measuring. E.g. Silent Token refresh on a 4G network when requesting a token for graph. A scenario can be associated with one or more measurements.

**Base build:** This is a build against which we compare performance of future builds. It would typically be the last release. It is configured on the Perf pipeline using the `baseBuildID` variable

**Basefiles:** These are the code marker files during the run of the base build and help us compare the current run against the base run

**Targetfiles:** These are the code marker files generated during the current run


### Steps to add a new scenario(s)/marker(s) and see it in the report:
#### Changes needed in Common - Java/Kotlin code
- If a new scenario has to be created, come up with a scenario code comprised of 3 unique random digits and add it to the codemarker definitions in file [PerfConstants.java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/dev/common/src/main/java/com/microsoft/identity/common/PerfConstants.java), you can find the existing scenario codes under ScenarioConstants in the same file.
- Come up with unique random digits to represent code markers you would like to add and add them to the codemarker definitions in file [PerfConstants.java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/dev/common/src/main/java/com/microsoft/identity/common/PerfConstants.java), see some examples under CodeMarkerConstants in the same file.
- Add codemarkers (e.g. start of the activity to be measured and the end of the activity to be measured) at desired places. See example in [CommandDispatcher.java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/dev/common/src/main/java/com/microsoft/identity/common/internal/controllers/CommandDispatcher.java#L197). Example events lines are given as follows:
	- `CodeMarkerManager.getInstance().markCode(CodeMarkersConstants.ACQUIRE_TOKEN_SILENT_START);`
	- `CodeMarkerManager.getInstance().markCode(CodeMarkersConstants.ACQUIRE_TOKEN_SILENT_FUTURE_OBJECT_CREATION_END);`
- Push the common code to dev branch by raising a PR.

#### Changes needed in the Report tool - C# code
- In the report tool code, open the file [PerfDataConfiguration.xml](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/dev/uiautomationutilities/perf_tool/PerfDataConfiguration.xml) and perform following actions:
	- In tag `MeasurementsConfigurations`, add a new `MeasurementsConfiguration`, set the Id to a random unique string of digits and the startMarker and endMarker according to what you defined in [this step](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/paul/update-perf-testing-documentation/uiautomationutilities/perf_tool/readme.md#changes-needed-in-common---javakotlin-code). Note that the full identifier of a marker is the scenario code preppended to the marker identifier. An example here would be if you defined the scenario code as 100 and the code marker as 10011 then the full identifier is 10010011. You can use the startskip and EndSkip variables to specify whether the report should include certain measurements or not
	- In tag, `Scenarios`, add a new scenario with the Measurement ID of the MesurementConfiguration just added above.
- Push the changes into dev branch by raising a PR.
- Deploy C# tool into the pipeline. (Pipeline information given at the start of this doc). We can deploy C# tool even before merging of PR if need be. As this deployment is done after building at the local machine.


#### Changes needed in the target library
- Write a new test case that targets the flow where code markers have been added, see existing test case [TestCasePerf.java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android/blob/dev/msalautomationapp/src/androidTest/java/com/microsoft/identity/client/msal/automationapp/testpass/perf/TestCasePerf.java) for non-brokered auth and [TestCasePerfBrokered.java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android/blob/dev/msalautomationapp/src/androidTest/java/com/microsoft/identity/client/msal/automationapp/testpass/perf/TestCasePerfBrokered.java) for brokered auth.
- In the new test case, before performing the particular scenario, add following code snippet
	- Enable the Code marker: `CodeMarkerManager.getInstance().setEnableCodeMarker(true);`
	- Setup the scenario code defined above: `CodeMarkerManager.getInstance().setPrefixScenarioCode("100");`
	- If we are having more than one iterations of same scenario, i.e. running same code multiple times, 
		- Make sure to clear the previous run's markers in the start of the iteration as follows: `CodeMarkerManager.getInstance().clearMarkers();`
		- Also write the content to the file using [FileAppender](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/dev/uiautomationutilities/src/main/java/com/microsoft/identity/client/ui/automation/logging/appender/FileAppender.java) such as [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android/blob/dev/msalautomationapp/src/androidTest/java/com/microsoft/identity/client/msal/automationapp/testpass/perf/TestCasePerf.java#L119-L124)
	- Also add followings after performing the particular scenario:
		- Clear the codemarkers: `CodeMarkerManager.getInstance().clearMarkers();`
		- Disable the codemarkers: `CodeMarkerManager.getInstance().setEnableCodeMarker(false);`
- Push the target library code to dev branch by raising a PR.

### Steps to deploy latest version of C# tool to pipeline:
- Install a recent version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) on Windows
- Ensure that you have the following tools selected while installing Visual Studio:
	- .NET desktop environment
	- Desktop development using C++
	- .NET Core cross-platform development
- Open the [location of the perf tool](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/tree/paul/update-perf-testing-documentation/uiautomationutilities/perf_tool) in Visual studio. You can this by opening [PerfIdentity.sln](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/paul/update-perf-testing-documentation/uiautomationutilities/perf_tool/PerfIdentity.sln) from Visual studio
- Build Solution by clicking on the Build -> Build Solution. Make sure Release build is chosen for deployment.
- Bundle following files into one zip file named `PerfRunnables.zip`:
	- a. Files `PerfIdentity.exe`, `PerfIdentity.runtimeconfig.json`, `PerfIdentity.dll` and `PerfIdentity.deps.json` from location  `bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1` and file `PerfDataConfiguration.xml` from root location of the project
- Go to the pipeline and then from the left side options, Open Library page and upload the file `PerfRunnables.zip` after deleting previous one (if exists)
- Go to the pipeline definition and make change in the task `Download Perf runnable package` by selecting the file name which was uploaded in the `secure file` drop down.
- Save the build definition. 


### Steps to baseline a build number:
- Go to the pipeline page where we can see the previous runs.
- From the list of the runs, Click the particular run which we want to choose as the baseline.
- From the URL, find the numberic value of the buildId and note it. For example buildId will be 708340 for following URL: https://dev.azure.com/IdentityDivision/IDDP/_build/results?buildId=708340&view=results
- Go to the run page of the pipeline again.
- Go to the definition of the pipeline by clicking on the `Edit` button on the top right.
- Click on variables.
- Change the value of the variable `baseBuildID` with the value we have noted in the steps above.
- Save the pipeline definition.
	
### Steps to run on the pipeline:
- Go to the pipeline
- Click on `Run pipeline`
- Choose the right branch (default dev) and click on `Run`
	
### Steps to run on the pipeline when Basefiles are not available or are corrupted.
- First try to change the baseline build to such a build which has target files available in the artifacts (as given steps in another section) and it should work. If this does not work then follow next steps.
- If you have handful perfData txt files which you want to make basefiles, zip these files. The file names should start with PerfData and extension should be txt.
- Upload this zip file in the library by following these steps:
	- Go to the pipeline
	- Click on Library on the left menu.
	- Click on Secure files
	- Upload the zip file here by clicking `+ Secure file` and following steps.
- Go to the pipeline and click on Edit
- Temporarily disable `Download Base file(s)` task
- Enable `Download Perf Base files` task
- Enable `Unzip Perfbase files` task
- In task Download PerfBase files choose a secure File (the zip file which was uploaded in previous steps) which will be considered as a bundle of the basefiles.
- Save and run the pipeline.
- After the successful run, make sure to disable `Download Perf Base files` and `Unzip Perfbase files` and also make sure to enable `Download Base file(s)`


### Steps to run on local machine:
- Checkout msal native code recursively. 
- Open the msal native code in Android studio and point the dependency builds to local variants.
- Run one of the Test case having the codemarkers enabled. e.g. `TestCasePerf.java`, `TestCasePerfBrokerHost.java` on an Android device.
- On local windows machine create directories to keep your base and target codemarker files. e.g. `C:\testdata\basefiles` and `C:\testdata\targetfiles`
- Download base files from any of the build run by going to the artifacts, clicking on Perf and then clicking on basefiles. For example go to "https://dev.azure.com/IdentityDivision/IDDP/_build/results?buildId=705958&view=results", click on artifact button "2 published; 1 consumed", click on Perf and then download basefiles. 
- Extract and put the raw basefiles in your local base file folder of your machine.
- On local windows machine go to your target codemarker files location and download the codemarker files named as "PerfData*.txt" from the android device from location "/sdcard" : (Note: make sure that the test case has completed before running the download command)
- Open the Perf C# tool in visual studio by opening the solution file `PerfIdentity.sln`
- Build the project by clicking on Build -> Build Solution
- Copy `PerfDataConfiguration.xml` into the build folder e.g. `bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1`
- Run the application. Arguments definition can be seen in `command.cs` file.


### Where is the raw Perfdata.txt stored in local run as well as in pipeline run
- In local run, the Perfdata txt files can be stored on any directory which should be given to the C# tool as an argument. e.g. `C:\testdata\basefiles` and `C:\testdata\targetfiles`
- On pipeline, we can find the txt files from artifact "Perf -> basefiles" or "Perf -> targetfiles"


### Where to find the intermediate files or output files
- If output directory is default i.e. "." then the output files will be created in the directory where the applicaiton is running.
- Default directory of output files: `bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1`


### Arguments to the tool:
- Directory where PerfData base files are present. Example value: `C:\testdata\basefiles`
- Directory where PerfData target files are present. Example value: `C:\testdata\targetfiles`
- Build id of the base task - configured using the `baseBuildID` variable
- Build id which should be written in the final Email report and used for going to artifact url. Example value: `1234`
- Device model to be written in the final Email report. Example value: `Pixel2`
- Device OS to be written in the final Email report. Example value: `API28`
- App name to be written in the Email report. Example value: `MSALTestApp`
- Email ID of the sender's account. Example value: `idlab1@msidlab4.onmicrosoft.com` - configured using the `senderEmail` variable
- Password of the sender's account - picked from a key vault using the task `Azure Key Vault: Download Password for email user`
- Email To list separated by comma - configured using the `recipientEmails` variable

### Email report:
- At the moment the email report is quite simple, it's constructed within the [View.cs](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/paul/update-perf-testing-documentation/uiautomationutilities/perf_tool/View.cs) and then the [ReportHelper sends the email](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/blob/paul/update-perf-testing-documentation/uiautomationutilities/perf_tool/ReportHelper.cs#L138-L158) using the credentials passed as arguments to the tool. The email to send the report from is configured on the pipeline as `senderEmail`, the password to the `senderEmail` is picked from a key vault using the task `Azure Key Vault: Download Password for email user` and the list of emails to get the report are configured using the variable `recipientEmails`
