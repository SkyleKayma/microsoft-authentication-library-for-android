/**
 * A custom noop implementation of {@link OpenTelemetry} to be used in MSAL for scenarios where
 * minSdkVersion of calling application {@literal <} 24. The reason for this is because the default no-op
 * implementation uses "static interface methods" and these get left out of the APK for applications
 * whose MIN SDK is {@literal <} 24 and minification through R8 is DISABLED because the consumers-rules are NOT
 * honored when minification is disabled and R8 applies some default proguard rules that leaves
 * static interface methods out of the APK. This causes a "NoSuchMethodError" when such methods are
 * invoked.
 * This is not a problem for Broker Hosting applications as the MIN SDK for those is already {@literal >}= 24.
 * The issue only arises for the some MSAL consumers falling into the above situation. Tracing is
 * disabled by default anyway for MSAL (and only turned on for Broker) and Open Telemetry uses its
 * own Noop implementations, however, here we are just providing our own that DON'T use static
 * interface methods.
