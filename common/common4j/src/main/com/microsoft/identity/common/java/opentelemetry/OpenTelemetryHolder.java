/**
 * A custom safe Open Telemetry Instance holder that doesn't crash on the call to "get" Open
 * Telemetry. The motivation behind this is that all the Broker code has state that is per-process,
 * whereas other libraries such as Open Telemetry can carry state across processes. The default
 * Global Open Telemetry only allows initializing Open Telemetry once and subsequent calls to
 * initialize it will throw an error. This is problematic for code such as ours that runs in
 * multiple processes because we end up initializing OTel twice (once in app process and once in
 * auth process).
 * <p>
 * Open Telemetry itself recommends not using {@link io.opentelemetry.api.GlobalOpenTelemetry} and
 * with this change we are now moving away from that model.
 * TODO: We should make this even better by putting an instance of {@link OpenTelemetry} on the
 * {@link com.microsoft.identity.common.java.interfaces.IPlatformComponents} and completely move
 * away from static state, however, that requires us to then pass around either the components or
 * the Open Telemetry instances in all places where we want to create Spans and that change is
 * trivial in some areas of the code but more complex in other areas where we don't currently
 * pass platform components and therefore this will be handled in a separate PR.
